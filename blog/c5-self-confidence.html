							<strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong>
						</li>
						<p> Mindfulness is the lens that we observe the world and ourselves. It is not a weapon for defense or to attack what we
							see through the lens but instead it is a tool to clearly observe what is there. It does not refer to the past or the
							future it only looks at the now.
							</br>
							</br>
							Awareness is the realization of mindfulness. we do not retain the or discard the information that we discover we only maintain
							the awareness that it exists.
						</p>
						<li>
							<strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience
								of it? How did you feel?</strong>
						</li>
						<p>The body scan technique allowed me to consider why I might be in pain or to narrow down where I am actually hurting.
							It also allowed me to consider parts of myself that I often neglect and address why that might be.
						</p>
						<li>
							<strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>
						</li>
						<p>My understanding of this section was that we do not need to let our emotions control us and if we use mindfulness then
							we can better control our emotions allowing us to make better decisions </p>
