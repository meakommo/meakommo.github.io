						<li><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></li>
						<p>In the past when making a website I have generally just started with a nav bar and then just started slapping features together. creating a wireframe and allowing me to visualize what I was making before I made it helped me to create a coherent design and allowed me to consider ideas before wasting time creating them.</p>
						</br>
						<li><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong></li>
						<p>I love the idea of meditation and the concept of calming your mind in order to make clear concess desicions however it is not something that I have spent anytime doing.</p>
						</br>
						<li><strong> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong></li>
						<p>While it is not new information to me I love the idea of taking a moment from your day to clear your mind so that you can better focus on what is important.</p>
						</br>
						<li><strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong></li>
						<p>Keeping my back straight stood out to me as I find myself constantly reminding myself to sit straight in my day to day life.</p>
