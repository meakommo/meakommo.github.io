                        <strong> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Pleasure</strong> is the Rockstar outlook on life, it is the instant gratification you get from winning
                        the lottery or getting a bonus at work. However this way of life is not something that everyone can
                        constantly enjoy unless they are a rockstar or millionaire. For the more down to earth and normal
                        people we only get to enjoy lifes pleasures in small doses but we can structure our lives so that
                        we can enjoy lifes pleasures more often by doing a job that we enjoy , by engaging in hobbies and
                        surrounding ourselves with people who we enjoy the company of.</br>
                        </br>
                        <strong>Passion</strong> or as Search inside yourself describes it "Flow" is the point at which we enjoy
                        doing something so much our work ethic is optimal. By doing a job that we enjoy we find that we never
                        really work we are always playing and this causes us to be passionate about what we are doing and
                        in turn causes us to put in more effort.</br>
                        </br>
                        <strong>Purpose</strong> Is the feeling that we are working toward something that is greater than ourselves
                        that we truly care about. and this in turn causes us to reach our peak performance level allowing
                        us to exceed our regular levels of efficiency.

                        <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What are your core values?</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>Over anything else I value honesty. When someone is dishonest including myself this leads me to feel sadness and question all future descisions and actions made by the individuel.
                         This is particularly true when it comes to the professional workspace, if I feel that I have been mislead by my manager then this can cause me to become less motivated and even 
                         cause me to seek alternative employement.

                        <strong>What do you stand for?</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>I believe that everyone should be judged on their merits and not on their gender, race or even for any political reason. People thrive on knowing that their actions are being appreciated
                         and like to feel like they matter, however sadly this type of gratification is rare in the corporate space at least in my expierance.

                        <strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>I found this concept quited interesting, The idea that through meditation anyone can find an inner calm within themselves is great food for thought.
                         However in order to fully see the benefits that it provides I will have to get frustrated about something :)
