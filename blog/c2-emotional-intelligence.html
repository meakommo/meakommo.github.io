					<h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

				</header>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></li>
					<p>This chapter emphasized the importance of emotional intelligence in the work place and how awareness of yourself and others can help to build better workplace dynamics. </p>
					<li><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></li>
					<p>I found that the two minutes of mindfulness helped me silence my mind and allowed me to focus on what I needed to do, at least for a little while.</p>
					</br>
					<li><strong>Reflection</strong></li>
					<p>I really like the idea of the mindfulness exercises. a lot of time when we learn how to perform a new task we focus sololy on said task and never take a moment to digest what we are learning and I believe that a lot of the mindfulness exercises can help us digest what we do.</p>
