							<strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									1: blocked on a simple Problem
								</li>

								<li>
									2: Solved a problem in an elegant way
								</li>

								<li>What was the problem?</li>

								<p>insert any story about working in helpdesk</p>

								<li>What did you learn?</li>

								<p></p>

								<li>What problem solving techniques did you use?</li>

								<p>Googling it's help desk the answer is always Googling</p>

								<li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>

								<p>It's Help desk I hated my life</p>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Reflection</strong></li>	
								<p>Reflection is a very useful technique as it can help you fix problems you didn't realize you had and set you up to make the next step</p>	
								<li>Pseudocode</li>
								<p>
									psudocode has it's place sometimes it can be helpful to use psudocode as a kind of wireframe before you begin writing the real code
								</p>
								<li>Trying something</li>
								<p>
									I love this method. Just give it a go and don't be afraid to be wrong.
								</p>
								<li>Rubber ducky method</li>
								<p>
									I use this method more then I care to admit
								</p>
								<li>Reading error messages</li>
								<p>
									if you don't use all of the tools that you have available to you then you are shooting yourself in the foot. and error logs are one of the best tools
								</p>
								<li>Console.logging</li>
								<p>
									Console logging can help you determine where and when a problem occurs in your code and can be more useful then error logs at times
								</p>
								<li>Googling</li>
								<p>
									Google is one of the fastest ways to access the vast knowledge that the human race has stockpiled.
								</p>
								<li>Asking your peers for help</li>
								<p>I often avoid asking for help until I am truely stuck</p>
								<li>Asking coaches for help</li>
								<p>
									As with asking peers for help if you do not allow yourself to solve a problem on your own then you restrict your ability to learn
								</p>
								<li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
								<p>
									Reflecting on your actions can often lead to improving your process.
