						<li><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong></li>
						<p>Beginning my EDA journey i am very excited. I find that I learn best by doing and that is exactly what EDA offer.</p>
						<li><strong>What are your impressions?</strong></li>
						<p>In regards to Shereef's analogy about the cook and the consumer I love this. The very idea of comparing coding to cooking is great and anyone that had ever tried to cook a meal with only a list of ingredients will understand that trial and error as well as problem solving can be rewarding.</p>
						<li><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></li>
						<p>When working as server support I often found myself working with the software team to address issues with the SAAS platforms which is what made me want to make the jump from tech support to software developer. however working in this role was a very consumer approach to knowledge someone would give you a solution you would apply it and make a note of the problem and the solution. Being the one to create the solution is an exciting prospect and I look forward to the journey</p>
						<li><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong></li>
						<p>Before starting my first sprint I incorrectly made the assumption that phase 0 would be 90% theory with a lot of reading however since starting I have found that a lot of it is practical with emphasis on learning and using industry tools</p>
						<li><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong></li>
						<p>I would be lying if I said that it does not make me nervous, I am a nervous person however as I have learnt to do I will put one step in front of the other and let my excitement overcome the fears</p>
