					<li><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong></li>
						<p>One of the reasons I started Dev academy over and making the move into software development is because I find programming relaxing even when I get stuck
                            the beautiful thing about this type of work is that if you have a problem you can be almost certain that somebody has had the problem before and has looked for 
                            help on the subject, software like Stack Overflow came about to facilitate in the asking of such questions. obviously I find myself frustrated at getting stuck on a problem but this just
                            drives me to find a solution. Every problem that I struggle to solve today is a problem I can solve tomorrow.

                        <li><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong></li>
						<p>I love the idea behind this exercise and I think that taking this approach to problems in your life would allow you to make a more informed response and take emotion out of the equation.
                             We are often told to stop and take a breath when we are upset but often we are never taught to notice and reflect on why we are upset and by doing so we can avoid becoming upset by 
                            a similar problem in the future.
