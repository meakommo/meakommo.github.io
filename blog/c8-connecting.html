							<strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong>
						</li>
						<p>
							Often when I talk to people I am quite reservered about my opinion as it can be a cause of distain and often only open up with people when they are the one that start the conversation,
							 however I sometimes find myself actively engaging someone in order to build better terms with them. Conversation over lunch or while in a vehicle are a great way to build rapport with 
							 a person or group or people as they force you to either talk to each other or actively avoid taking. 
						</p>

						<li>
							<strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong>
						</li>
						<p>
							Empathic listening is a great device for creating the building blocks to a better relationship either with your significant other or with your peers this is something I definatly plan to do in the future

							<strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong>
						</li>
						<p>
							When doing the loving kindness meditation I found that It degraded into regular mediation, however on the bright side I felt more relaxed which helped me in my day.
