						<li><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></li>
						<p>Compassion is an often forgotten part of social interactions, this is particularly true when it comes to leadership.
							as a leader if you are able to sympathise with those working for you then you can better understand what motivates them and in turn motivate them better.

                        <li><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></li>
						<p>The main take away from this exercise was that everyone in the world contains at least a little goodness inside of them. This meditation focuses on how to multiplying
							the goodness that we all have inside of us. For me what I took away from this exercise was to stop for a moment and just think about how you could be nicer to someone 
							and that for everyone bad encounter with an individual it will take 3 good encounters to even out how they perceive you. 
						</p>
						</br>
						
                        <li><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></li>
						<p>The idea of Tonglen meditation is that we visualize taking in the pain of others with every in-breath and sending out whatever will benefit them on the out-breath. This very 
							 concept lends itself to the idea of pausing taking a breath thinking to yourself how can I benefit not only myself but everyone else and then acting with that in mind.

                        <li><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to boot camp?</strong></li>
						<p>To answer the question how did it apply so far I will need to break down the SCARF model. In terms of status I found that the weekly check ins really helped me feel that I was apart of 
							a group and that I was an important group member, this was compounded further by actually meeting members of my cohort in person at the Auckland campus. 
							Certainty, with respect to certainty going through bootcamp I was a bit uncertain, I had just handed over a very large sum of money so that I could study programming and enter into 
							the field as a developer, however the further I moved through phase zero the more faith I have that I made the right decision and that it was money well spent. With regards to phase zero autonomy is 
							something that I struggle with. While I find myself highly motivated in a work environment I often find it hard to stay focused at home and this can cause me to fall behind. knowing this about myself 
							I decided to come into the Auckland campus where distractions were limited and I could focus on my work. The Slack chats and weekly check-ins helped me relate to the other members of my cohort 
							and allowed me to feel as though I belonged in this group. Finally with regards to fairness, I found that the EDA staff have been fair and transparent with regards to what we are expected to do and 
							with providing us with all the resources we need to succeed.
