					<p>Often when working in help desk we would find ourselves having to convince customers to humor us and perform a task that

						<strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong>
					</li>
					<p> Mindfulness is the lens that we observe the world and ourselves. It is not a weapon for defense or to attack what we
						see through the lens but instead it is a tool to clearly observe what is there. It does not refer to the past or the
						future it only looks at the now.
						</br>
						</br>
						Awareness is the realization of mindfulness. we do not retain the or discard the information that we discover we only maintain
						the awareness that it exists.

						<strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong>

					<p>In the past when making a website I have generally just started with a nav bar and then just started slapping features
						together. creating a wireframe and allowing me to visualize what I was making before I made it helped me to create
						a coherent design and allowed me to consider ideas before wasting time creating them.</p>
